TESLaCU mpi-decomposed object classes for reading, writing, and analyzing
data from CFD simulations. Originally written with Athena-RFX in mind, they
are nevertheless fully adaptable to any CFD package, especially those
packages that use serial and/or parallel IO libraries that have Python
wrappers (e.g. HDF5, VTK, and NetCDF all have Python implementations).

this folder includes three classes: mpiAnalyzer, mpiReader, and mpiWriter

currently mpiReader and mpiWriter only provide readers and writers for
MPI-IO raw binary

mpiAnalyzer has a fully-functioning factory function and the user can
choose between different pure-Python numerical backends (Akima-spline-based
flux differencing, central finite differencing, and Fourier
differentiation), however I have only ever used this class to analyze HIT
from Athena-RFX and so it comes without warranty for any other purpose for
the time being
